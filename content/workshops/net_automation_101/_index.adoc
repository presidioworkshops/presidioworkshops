= Network Automation 101 Workshop

== **Why Automate?**

=== Digital transformation – Moving workloads between Private and Public Clouds
=== Organizations are modernizing their business strategies and technologies to better support customer needs
=== As companies embrace digital transformation, they need to move at the pace of software, new apps, new clouds and new technologies
=== Traditional network engineering and administration often do not align with those requirements

---
== **By adopting network automation organizations can take advantage of the following:**

== **Standardized Processes**

=== Reduced chance of human errors, which affect network performance and security
=== Eliminate manual network tasks and enhance network functionality

== **Robust Quality Control**

=== Integrated testing
=== Ability to locate and identify the root cause of network or security issues before deploying to production
  
== **Speed and Agility**

=== Continuous Improvement
=== Rapid provisioning of new services, self service provisioning, enhancements, and upgrades

---

== **What's The Fear?**

== **Culture change**
=== Organization commitment
=== Top down, bottom up

== **Willingness to learn new things**
=== Takes 15 minutes for me to do it, it will take me hours to automate

---

== **Machines should do repetitive work, people should do problem solving!**

---
== **The Network Automation Workshop**

=== We have designed a network automation workshop to help network engineers become familiar with the technology
=== To overcome some of the fears

---

== **We have broken it down into the following stages:**
