== Stage 4 PreDeployment Testing

image::s4-0.png['Stages', 1000]

== In Stage 4, we will discuss the process of testing a change.  

== We will run through some of the concepts to understand how to use Batfish and a Linux container to perform testing.

== Performing automated test is one of the advantages to help reduce risk during a change to the network.  

---

== Here are the requirements for Stage 4

== Here is a diagram of Stage 4.  This shows all the technology we will be using in Stage 4.  

== It also defines the use cases we will be working on in Stage 4.

== **Let's Do Some Testing**
[IMPORTANT]
Login to the Gitlab-CE Server (Server 2) as a user

=== Let’s start with creating a new issue and Merge Request in Gitlab network Automation Repository

=== Click on the Network Automation Project
=== Click Issues, then new issue


=== Provide a title **Testing** for the issue and add the following description:
[source, bash]
----
- [ ] Adding traditional and model testing with Batfish
----


image::s4-19.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title='Testing New Issue', 500]


=== Click preview and notice the checklist
=== Click create issue
=== Assign yourself to the issue on the far right

[IMPORTANT]
Write down the new branch name, 2-testing

=== Click create a merge request and new branch

---

=== Click assign to me
=== Click create a merge request

[IMPORTANT]
A Merge request doesn’t make any changes, but don’t close the merge request

image::s4-20.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title='Merge Request', 500]

=== Click Code -> Branches
=== Notice the new merge request, new issue, and new branch

---

== **Let's Go Bring Down The Latest Version Of The Repository**

=== Go to a remote location where you have a copy of the remote repository from your Gitlab server
=== Perform the following to get latest copy of the remote repository
=== Below was done from the VS Code terminal

---


=== Notice that I am starting out on the 1-network-change branch, lets switch to the master branch
=== It’s a good idea to check if your local repository is out of date from the remote repository

[source, bash]

<1> This local repository is out of date and needs to be updated

== **Lets update the local repository**
=== Run the following command from VS Code

[source, bash]
----
git pull origin master
----

=== Notice the only branch is master and 1-network-change
=== We can pull down the remote network change branch using the following command:
[source, bash]
---- 
git fetch 
----
=== But you need to create a new branch in the local repository using the following command:
[IMPORTANT]
Your branch name maybe different
[source, bash]
----
git branch 2-testing
----
=== Then let’s switch to that branch with the following command:
[source, bash]
----
git checkout 2-testing
----

[source, bash]

== **Let's Create Some Tests**
=== Let's build an Ansible Playbook to create the testing
=== Let's use Visual studio code to create the tests folder
=== Let’s review the files in the tests directory

image::s4-21.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title='Tests File Structure', 200]

---

=== Let’s review the snapshots.yaml file:

[source, bash]

- name: CAPTURE DATE AND CREATE DIRECTORY
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Capture Date
      command: date +"%Y-%m-%d"
      register: time

      delegate_to: localhost
    - name: Create Directory
      file:
        path: /home/gitlab-runner/network-automation/configs
        state: directory 
  run_once: yes

      copy:
        content: "{{ output.stdout[0] }}"
        dest: "/home/gitlab-runner/network-automation/configs/show_run_{{ inventory_hostname }}.txt"
----

---

=== Let’s review the Batfish.py file:

[source, bash]
----
# Modules
from pybatfish.client.commands import bf_init_snapshot, bf_session
from pybatfish.question.question import load_questions
from pybatfish.question import bfq
import os
# Variables
bf_address = "127.0.0.1"
snapshot_path = "/home/gitlab-runner/network-automation/"
output_dir = "/home/gitlab-runner/network-automation/"
# Body
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Setting host to connect
    bf_session.host = bf_address
    # Loading confgs and questions
    bf_init_snapshot(snapshot_path, overwrite=True)
    load_questions()
    # Running questions
    r = bfq.nodeProperties().answer().frame()
    assert r.empty is False
    print(r)
    r1 = bfq.nodeProperties(properties="SNMP_Trap_servers").answer().frame()
    assert r1.empty is False
    print(r1)

    print("ANALYSIS // lpmRoutes()")
    r2 = bfq.lpmRoutes(ip='192.168.14.1').answer().frame()
    assert r2.empty is False
    print(r2)
    # Saving output
    if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
        os.mkdir(output_dir)
    r.to_csv(f"{output_dir}/results.csv")

=== In the previous section we automated a change to add vlan 14 and subnet 192.168.14.0/24 to the leaf3 switch
=== As part of the Containerlab deployment, we created 3 Linux clients
=== We can use one or all of the clients to perform traditional tests like Ping and Traceroute
=== Let’s add a new test stage to the CI/CD file -> .gitlab-ci.yml

[source, bash]
----
stages:
- build
- stage
- change
- test
- backup
----
---

=== Since the Linux clients are docker containers
=== We can use the Docker Exec command to update the networking stack on third client
=== Lets add an IP address of 192.168.14.8 to eth1 of the Linux client
=== Lets add the default route to point to the new vlan interface of 192.168.14.1
=== Delete the existing default route
=== Add a ping and traceroute to test the change

[source, bash]
----
test_traditional_switches:
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - sleep 60
  script:
    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 ifconfig eth1 192.168.14.8 netmask 255.255.255.0
    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 route add default gw 192.168.14.1 eth1 || true
    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 route delete default gw 172.20.20.1 eth0 || true
    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 ping -c 5 192.168.14.1
    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 traceroute 192.168.11.1
----

Now lets reference the batfish.py file in the CI/CD file in a new stage

[source, bash]
----
test_model_switches:
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - cd tests
    - docker rmi -f $(docker images -q --filter=reference="batfish/allinone:latest") || true
  script:
    - docker run -d --restart=always --name batfish -v batfish-data:/data -p 8888:8888 -p 9997:9997 -p 9996:9996 batfish/allinone || true
    - ansible-playbook snapshots.yaml -v 
    - python3 -m venv venv
    - source venv/bin/activate
    - pip install pybatfish
    - python3 batfish.py
----

=== Now lets go push the changes to the remote repository 
=== Remember to save the files first!

[source, bash]

== **Let's Try Something**
=== Change the traditional test to ping an interface that doesn’t exist
=== Change the lpm route in the the batfish.py file to a network that doesn’t exist


[source, bash]
----
    print("ANALYSIS // lpmRoutes()")
    r2 = bfq.lpmRoutes(ip='192.168.15.1').answer().frame() <1>
    assert r2.empty is False
    print(r2)
----

=== Change the .gitlab-ci.yml file

[source, bash]
----
test_traditional_switches:
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - sleep 60
  script:
    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 ifconfig eth1 192.168.14.8 netmask 255.255.255.0
    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 route add default gw 192.168.14.1 eth1 || true

    - docker exec clab-Arista-2s-3l-client3 traceroute 192.168.11.1

----

<1> E.g. 192.168.15.1

=== Save the file and and push the change to master branch and watch the pipeline fail

---
== End Result

=== At this point, we have incorporated automated and traditional testing with the new change using the Git Workflow of creating an issue and a Merge Request.
