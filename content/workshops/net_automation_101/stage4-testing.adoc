== **Stage 4 PreDeployment Testing**
== Estimate time to complete: 45 minutes
image::s4-0.png['Stages', 1000]

== In Stage 4, we will discuss the process of testing a change.  

== We will run through some of the concepts to understand how to use Batfish and a Linux container to perform tradional testing.

== Performing automated testing is one of the advantages to help reduce risk during a change to the network.  

---

== Here are the requirements for Stage 4

== Here is a diagram of Stage 4.  This shows all the technology we will be using in Stage 4.  

== It also defines the use cases we will be working on in Stage 4.

== **Let's Do Some Testing**
[IMPORTANT]
Login to the Gitlab-CE Server (Server 2) as a user

=== We just created a change, but what if the change breaks the network
=== We need to test the change deploying to production
=== Let’s start with creating a new issue and Merge Request in Gitlab network Automation Repository

=== Click on the Network Automation Project
=== Click Issues, then new issue


=== Provide a title **Testing** for the issue and add the following description:
[source, bash]
----
- [ ] Adding traditional and model testing with Batfish
----


image::s4-19.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title='Testing New Issue', 500]


=== Click preview and notice the checklist
=== Click create issue
=== Assign yourself to the issue on the far right

[IMPORTANT]
Write down the new branch name, 2-testing

=== Click create a merge request and new branch

---

=== Click assign to me
=== Click create a merge request

[IMPORTANT]
A Merge request doesn’t make any changes, but don’t close the merge request

image::s4-20.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title='Merge Request', 500]

=== Click Code -> Branches
=== Notice the new merge request, new issue, and new branch

---

== **Let's Go Bring Down The Latest Version Of The Repository**

=== Go to a remote location where you have a copy of the remote repository from your Gitlab server
=== Perform the following to get latest copy of the remote repository
=== Let's continue to use VS Code to make our changes

---


=== Notice that I am starting out on the 1-network-change branch, lets switch to the master branch
=== It’s a good idea to check if your local repository is out of date from the remote repository

<1> This local repository is out of date and needs to be updated

== **Lets update the local repository**
=== Run the following command from VS Code

[source, bash]
----
git pull origin master
----

=== Notice the only branch is master and 1-network-change
=== We can pull down the remote testing branch using the following command:
[source, bash]
---- 
git fetch 
----
=== But you still need to create a new local testing branch in the local repository using the following command:
[IMPORTANT]
Your branch name maybe different
[source, bash]
----
git branch 2-testing
----
=== Then let’s switch to that branch with the following command:
[source, bash]
----
git checkout 2-testing

=== Here is a progression of the commands above

== **Let's Create Some Tests**
=== Let's build an Ansible Playbook to create the testing
=== Let's use Visual studio code to review the tests folder
=== Let’s review the files in the tests directory

image::s4-21.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title='Tests File Structure', 200]

=== Let’s review the snapshots.yaml file:
=== This playbook will create a backup of the switch configurations for Batfish to use as a model.

----
<1> This is the location of where the configurations will be stored for Batfish to model.
---

=== Let’s review the Batfish.py file:
=== This is a python script to leverage the pybatfish model. 
=== Batfish uses a series of questions to test the network.  
=== The answers to the questions are based on the modeling done by Batfish against the configurations.
=== One of the benefits of Batfish is that it does not need the switches to be up and running to test functionality.

=== In the previous section we automated a change to add vlan 14 and subnet 192.168.14.0/24 to the leaf3 switch
=== As part of the Containerlab deployment, we created 3 Linux container clients
=== We can use one or all of the clients to perform traditional tests like Ping and Traceroute
=== Let’s add a new test stage to the CI/CD file -> .gitlab-ci.yml

[sidebar]
----
stages:
- build

- change
- test <1>
- backup

<1> Add the test stage to the .gitlab-ci.yml file

=== Since the Linux clients are docker containers
=== We can use the Docker Exec command to update the networking stack on third Linux client
=== Lets add an IP address of 192.168.14.8 to eth1 of the Linux client
=== Lets add the default route to point to the new vlan interface of 192.168.14.1
=== Delete the existing default route
=== Add a ping and traceroute to test the change
=== Add this job between network_change and the backup_switches
[source, bash]

=== This shows how the pipeline will fail if the test don't pass.
=== If the test dont't pass then nothing is eventually deployed to production.
=== Remember to change the configuration back to 192.168.14.1

== End Result



=== At this point, we have incorporated automated and traditional testing with the new change using the Git Workflow of creating an issue and a Merge Request.
