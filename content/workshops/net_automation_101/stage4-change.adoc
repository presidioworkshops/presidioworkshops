== **Stage 4 Automating A Change**
== Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes
image::s4-0.png['Stages', 1000]

== In Stage 4, we will discuss the process of automating a change.  

== We will run through some of the concepts to understand how to use Gitlab and a CI/CD pipeline to automate a change.

== Automating common tasks is one of the advantages to help increase efficency and standardize the network.  

---

== Here are the requirements for Stage 4

---

== Here is a diagram of Stage 4.  This shows all the technology we will be using in Stage 4.  

== It also defines the use cases we will be working on in Stage 4.

== **Let's Automate A Change**
[IMPORTANT]
Login to the Gitlab-CE Server (Server 2) as a user

=== One of the first things to do to follow the Gitlab flow.  
=== Create an issue in Gitlab to document the change. 
=== By creating an issue we can link it to the change
=== Click on the Network Automation Project
=== Click Issues, then new issue
=== Provide a title **Network Change** for the issue and add the following description:
[source, bash]
----
- [ ] Add a new Vlan and advertise it in BGP
- [ ] Add SNMP to the Spine Switches
----


image::s4-4.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title='Network Change New Issue', 400]


=== Click preview and notice the checklist
=== Click create issue

---

=== Assign yourself to the issue on the far right

image::s4-5.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title='Network Change New Issue', 400]

[IMPORTANT]
Write down the new branch name, 1-network-change

=== Click create a merge request and new branch

---


image::s4-6.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title='Merge Request', 500]


=== Click assign to me
=== Click create a merge request

[IMPORTANT]
A Merge request doesn’t make any changes, but don’t close the merge request

---
=== Click Code -> Branches
=== Notice the new merge request, new issue, and new branch

image::s4-7.png[caption="Figure 4: ", title='Code Branches', 200]
---

== **Let's Go Bring Down The Latest Version Of The Repository**

=== Go to a remote location where you have a copy of the remote repository from your Gitlab server
=== Perform the following to get latest copy of the remote repository
=== Lets use VS Code to make the change
[source, bash]

<1> Check the remote repository
<2> Notice the local repository is out of date
<3> Pull down the changes from the remote repository

---

=== Perform the following command to see the status of the branches
[source, bash]
----
git branch
----

=== Notice the only branch is master. We can pull down the remote network change branch using the following command, but we need to create a local branch: 
[source, bash]
----
git fetch 
----
=== You need to create a new local branch in the local repository using the following command:
[source, bash]
----
git branch 1-network-change
----
=== Then let’s switch to that branch with the following command:
[source, bash]
----
git checkout 1-network-change
----

=== The following output shows the progression of the commands above
[source, bash]

== **Let's Create A Change**
=== Let's build an Ansible Playbook to create the change
=== Let's continue to use Visual studio code to create the change
=== Let’s review the files in the change directory

image::s4-8.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title='Network Change File Structure', 200]

---

=== Let’s review the hosts file:

[source, bash]
----
all:
  children:
    leafs:
      hosts:
        clab-Arista-2s-3l-leaf3:
    spines:
      hosts:
        clab-Arista-2s-3l-spine1:
        clab-Arista-2s-3l-spine2:
----

=== Notice only one leaf switch and 2 spine switches
=== The change will only be deployed to those three devices

---

=== Let’s review the host_vars in clab-Arista-2s-3l-leaf3.yaml:
=== These are the variables defined to add a new vlan interface to leaf3
=== By creating this yaml file you can simplify the addition of vlan interfaces in the future
[IMPORTANT]
**This can be the one file completed by a help desk user in the future.  Easy to read without having to understand the commands required to configure the switches**

[source, bash]
----
---
configuration:
  vlans:
    vlan: 14
  ip_addr:
    ip: "192.168.14.1"
    mask: 24
----

---

=== **Let’s review the change.yaml file:**

[source, bash]
----

          lines:
            - ip address virtual {{ configuration.ip_addr.ip }}/{{ configuration.ip_addr.mask }}

----

<1> We are only making the following SNMP changes to the spine switches defined in the host file 
<2> The following are the changes to the leaf switches to add a new vlan and vlan interface:



image::s4-9.png[caption="Figure 6: ", title='Ansible Playbook For The Change For Spines', 500]

=== We are using Jinja2 templating to reference the hosts_vars we previously reviewed

image::s4-10.png[caption="Figure 7: ", title='Ansible Playbook For The Change For Leaves', 500]

=== Take a look at the clab-Arista-2s-3l-leaf3.yaml and pay attention to the structure
=== The file starts with configuration and then goes to vlans and then vlan

---

== **Now we need to add the change to CI/CD pipeline**
=== Using VS Code keep all the current configuration in the gitlab-ci.yml file, we just need to add to it
=== Add the following workflow and stage to the gitlab-ci.yml file using Visual Studio Code

[source, bash]
----
---
workflow: <1>
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG
      when: never
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == 'master'

stages:
  - build
  - stage
  - change <2>
  - backup

network_change: <3>
  stage: change
  before_script:
    - cd change
  script:
    - ansible-playbook change.yaml -v
  dependencies:
    - staging_switches
----

<1> Copy and paste the workflow section to the top of the .gitlab.ci file
<2> Add the - change stage to the stages section between stage and backup
<3> Copy and paste the network change stage in between the staging_switches stage and the backup_switches stage.
