      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s it! Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the Kubernetes environment. And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how containers and container orchestration works. Please feel free to continue to &amp;ldquo;kick the tires&amp;rdquo; in the demo environment we&amp;rsquo;ve setup and explore both the web console and the oc command line client.

      <title>Lab 1 - Welcome</title>

      <description>Welcome to Kubernetes! This lab provides a quick tour of the console to help you get familiar with the user interface along with some key terminology we will use in subsequent lab content. If you are already familiar with the basics of Kubernetes simply ensure you can login and create the project.
Key Terms We will be using the following terms throughout the workshop labs so here are some basic definitions you should be familiar with.</description>

      <title>Lab 2 - BYO Docker</title>

      <description>Bring your own docker It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get started with Kubernetes whether you&amp;rsquo;re using our app templates or bringing your existing docker assets. In this quick lab we will deploy an application using an exisiting docker image. Kubernetes will create an image stream for the image as well as deploy and manage containers based on that image. And we will dig into the details to show how all that works.</description>

      <title>Lab 3 - Deploying an App with S2I</title>
      <link>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab3-s2i/</link>

      <description>Source to Image (S2I) One of the useful components of OpenShift is its source-to-image capability. S2I is a framework that makes it easy to turn your source code into runnable images. The main advantage of using S2I for building reproducible docker images is the ease of use for developers. You&amp;rsquo;ll see just how simple it can be in this lab.
Let&amp;rsquo;s build a node.js web server using S2I We can do this either via the command line or the web console.</description>

      <title>Lab 4 - Developing and Managing Your Application</title>
      <link>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab4-devmanage/</link>

      <guid>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab4-devmanage/</guid>
      <description>Developing and managing an application in Kubernetes In this lab we will explore some of the common activities undertaken by developers working in Kubernetes. You will become familiar with how to use environment variables, secrets, build configurations, and more. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some of the basic things a developer might care about for a deployed app.
Setup From the previous lab you should have the DC Metro Maps web app running in Kubernetes.</description>

      <title>Lab 5 - Webhooks and Rollbacks</title>
      <link>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab5-rollbacks/</link>

      <guid>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab5-rollbacks/</guid>
      <description>Build Triggers, Webhooks and Rollbacks - Oh My! Once you have an app deployed in OpenShift you can take advantage of some continuous capabilities that help to enable DevOps and automate your management process. We will cover some of those in this lab: Build triggers, webhooks, and rollbacks.
A bit of configuration We are going to do some integration and coding with an external git repository. For this lab we are going to use github, if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have an account, you can create one here.</description>

      <title>Lab 6 - Replication and Recovery</title>
      <link>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab6-replicationrecovery/</link>

      <guid>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab6-replicationrecovery/</guid>
      <description>Things will go wrong, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we have replication and recovery Things will go wrong with your software, or your hardware, or from something out of your control. But we can plan for that failure, and planning for it let&amp;rsquo;s us minimize the impact. OpenShift supports this via what we call replication and recovery.
Replication Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through a simple example of how the replication controller can keep your deployment at a desired state.</description>

      <title>Lab 7 - Labels</title>
      <link>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab7-labels/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab7-labels/</guid>
      <description>Labels This is a pretty simple lab, we are going to explore labels. You can use labels to organize, group, or select API objects.
For example, pods are &amp;ldquo;tagged&amp;rdquo; with labels, and then services use label selectors to identify the pods they proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of pods, even treating pods with potentially different docker containers as related entities.
Labels on a pod In a previous lab we added our web app using a S2I template.</description>

      <title>Lab 8 - CI / CD Pipeline</title>
      <link>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab8-cicd/</link>

      <guid>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab8-cicd/</guid>
      <description>CI/CD Defined In modern software projects many teams utilize the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). By setting up a tool chain that continuously builds, tests, and stages software releases, a team can ensure that their product can be reliably released at any time. OpenShift can be an enabler in the creation and management of this tool chain.
In this lab we walk through creating a simple example of a CI/CD pipeline utlizing Jenkins, all running on top of OpenShift!</description>

      <title>Lab 9 - Blue | Green Deployment</title>
      <link>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab9-bluegreen/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://presidioworkshops.com/workshops/kubernetes_101/lab9-bluegreen/</guid>
      <description>Blue/Green deployments When implementing continuous delivery for your software one very useful technique is called Blue/Green deployments. It addresses the desire to minimize downtime during the release of a new version of an application to production. Essentially, it involves running two production versions of your app side-by-side and then switching the routing from the last stable version to the new version once it is verified. Using OpenShift, this can be very seamless because using containers we can easily and rapidly deploy a duplicate infrastructure to support alternate versions and modify routes as a service.</description>
