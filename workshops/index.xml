      <description>Why Automate? Digital transformation – Moving workloads between Private and Public Clouds  Organizations are modernizing their business strategies and technologies to better support customer needs  As companies embrace digital transformation, they need to move at the pace of software, new apps, new clouds and new technologies  Traditional network engineering and administration often do not align with those requirements     By adopting network automation organizations can take advantage of the following:   Standardized Processes Reduced chance of human errors, which affect network performance and security  Eliminate manual network tasks and enhance network functionality    Robust Quality Control Integrated testing  Ability to locate and identify the root cause of network or security issues before deploying to production    Speed and Agility Continuous Improvement  Rapid provisioning of new services, self service provisioning, enhancements, and upgrades     What’s The Fear?</description>
